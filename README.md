# IS218TeamProject

1. Calculator (Directory)
***
* Calculator Class
   * That has all the math methods below in one file that makes it easier to call it later. 

* Methods 
  * Addition Function: Sum of two numbers   
  * Subtraction function that subtract two numbers 
   
  * Square Function: Square the numbers 
 
  * SquareRoot function: that squareRoot a number
    
  * Division Function: Divide two numbers. Catch error with Except if it is divided by a zero. 
  
  * Product function, that multiply two numbers 
***

2. Statistic (Directory )
***
* Statistics: Has all the Stats Methods below 
  
* Methods Stats Function
  * Mean: Call the addition and division method.
  
   * Median: Call the division method.
   
  * Mode: Calculate most common integer
  
  * Standard Deviation: Call the mean  and square method
  
  * Variance: Call the function Standard Deviation and use the Calculator class for the square method.
  
  * Quartiles: Use the Numpy library
  
  * Skewness: Use the Scipy Library
  
  * Sample Correlation: Use the calculator class by calling addition , square , subtraction and square root methods 
  
  * Population Correlation: Use the calculator class by calling addition , square , subtraction and square root methods 
  
  * Z-Score: Use Scipy Library, Use mean and population variance methods
  
  * Mean Deviation / Mean Absolute Deviation: Use the Numpy Library
  
* Population Sampling Function (Statistics)
  * Simple random sampling: Use as sample data for formulas and tests 
  
  * Systematic sampling: Use the Calculator class to call the addition method.
  
  * Confidence Interval For a Sample: Use the Mean, Z-score and Standard Dev methods
  
  * Margin of Error: Use the Z-score, Standard Dev, square root methods
  
  * Sample Size Formula (known, unknown, Cochranâ€™s): Use Scipy Library, Use the product, square, division, margin error, mean confidence interval, sample standard deviation, and Z-score class methods
